# Technical Implementation Notes

## Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure
- Used BEM for CSS class naming
- Simple components, focused on their specific functionality
- Avoided complex component architecture to maintain simplicity for this test
- Chose not to create a reusable card component to keep the implementation straightforward and focused on the test requirements

### Cart Implementation
- Implemented cart as a slide-out panel using CSS transforms
- Used CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Added loading state with spinner animation and 1 sec animation
- Prevent background scrolling when cart open

### Styling Approach
- Mobile-first dev
- Used SASS variables
- Implemented responsive design patterns for different screen sizes
- Used brand colors from the brief

### JavaScript Implementation
- Vanilla JS without frameworks
- Implemented event handling
- Separated webpack and SASS compilation into different terminal processes for better reliability and clearer output

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Used CSS transforms for animations to leverage GPU acceleration
- Optimized asset loading and bundling with webpack
- Separated webpack and SASS watchers to improve development workflow

### Accessibility
- Added proper ARIA attributes to cart dialog
- Added keyboard navigation
- Ensured proper focus management
- Added descriptive labels for screen readers
- Fixed aria-hidden warning by properly managing focus and visibility states

### Browser Support
- Tested in modern browsers
- Added favicon support for various devices and browsers

## Development Setup
- Split webpack and SASS compilation into separate terminal processes
- Webpack handles JavaScript bundling and watching
- SASS compiler handles style compilation and watching
- This separation provides clearer error messages and more reliable watching

## Future Improvements
- Could implement more reusable components such as product cards
- Could add more interactive features to cart (animations, hover states)
- Could add more comprehensive error handling
- Could implement a more sophisticated component architecture if needed for a larger project

## Testing Notes
- Tested on various screen sizes
- Verified cross-browser compatibility
- Tested cart functionality across different devices
